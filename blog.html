                        <p class="card-text">Earlier only var is there and he is the king of variable declarations. But
                            there are some issues associated with variables declared with var, though. That is why let
                            and const introduced. It's an enhanced version of var, it solves all the problems that come
                            with the var keyword. Like, let is a block-scoped variable and we cannot re-declared but can
                            be updated(re-assigned). You'll see in the below example as it shows that let is preferable
                            over var. Const declarations share some similarities with let declarations, but const
                            variables cannot be updated or re-declared. It maintains the constant values. Unlike var and
                            let, if we are using const then it must be initialized at the same time when we declared the
                            variable.</p>

                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p class="card-text">Arrow functions have been adopted since ECMAScript 2015, and it's a simple
                            yet very powerful feature. However, an arrow function isn't the same as a normal function.
                            Then what's different? JavaScript arrow functions are roughly the equivalent of lambda
                            functions in python or blocks in Ruby, but they have more intricate details. Arrow functions
                            allow a developer to accomplish the same result with fewer lines of code and approximately
                            half the typing. Curly brackets aren't required if only one expression is present, and it
                            will implicitly return this result from the function.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array
                            but does not change the array and it returns undefined. map() executes the same code on
                            every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements. filter() checks
                            every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with
                            the elements that return truthy for the criteria. The ES6 find() method returns the value of
                            the first element that passes a testing function. If no values satisfy the testing function,
                            undefined is returned.</p>

                            can instead write the text as needed with line breaks. We can also surround some of the text
                            inside single quotes and it would be displayed without any issue. We can also add dynamic
                            content inside the template string. This is possible by defining the variable needed inside
                            curly braces with a dollar sign in front of it.</p>
